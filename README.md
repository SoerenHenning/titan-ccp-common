# Titan CCP - Common

The [Titan Control Center](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2020.100050)
is a scalable and extensible analytics platform for [Industrial DevOps](https://industrial-devops.org/en).
It analyzes and visualizes data streams from Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors
(e.g. electrical power consumption) in industrial production.

This repository contains common library code and record definitions for all microservices of the Titan Control Center.

## Build

We use Gradle as a build tool. In order to build the project run
`./gradlew build` on Linux/macOS or `./gradlew.bat build` on Windows.
